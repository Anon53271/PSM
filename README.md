# Faster Training of Diffusion Models and Improved Density Estimation via Parallel Score Matching


Code for reproducing the experiments in the paper:

'Faster Training of Diffusion Models and Improved Density Estimation via Parallel Score Matching'.

Experiments where the diffusion time interval is separated into equal subintervals can be found in the folder 'Equal_subintervals'. In this folder one can also find the DPSM experiments.

Experiments where the diffusion time interval is separated into unequal subintervals can be found in the folder 'Unequal_subintervals'. This folder only contains TPSM experiments.
